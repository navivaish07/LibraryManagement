The provided code is a simple Library Management System that helps manage students, their issued books, and the books available in the library. It allows the user to input student details, such as their name, ID, and stream, and tracks which books each student has issued. A student can issue up to two books, and the system keeps a count of how many books each student has checked out.

The books available in the library are stored in a Binary Search Tree (BST), which ensures that they are organized in sorted order. This makes it easy to check if a book is available in the library and display the collection of books in alphabetical order. The system also supports sorting students by their ID number using the Selection Sort algorithm, allowing for a clear, ordered list of students.

By using a BST for book storage and an array for student details, the system provides an organized way to manage both students and books. The main functionalities include adding books to the library, issuing books to students, displaying student details along with their issued books, and showing the library's available books in sorted order.

This system is helpful because it streamlines the process of managing students and books, keeps track of which student has which book, and ensures that books are easily accessible and organized. With some modifications, it can be extended for more advanced library management features, like handling returns, overdue books, and more.
